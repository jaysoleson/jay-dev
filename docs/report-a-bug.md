# Reporting a Bug

!!! important
    DO NOT report bugs found on a LifeGen save to ClanGen!!

Thank you for taking interest in reporting a bug to the LifeGen team! We're aware there's a lot of them -- we apologize for the inconvenience.

Unfortunately, for now, LifeGen only officially takes bug reports reported to the [LifeGen Server's](https://discord.gg/8zzYaTD6Q5) #bugs and #dialogue-bugs. GitHub issues has not yet been set-up.

## Bugs as a result of Save Editing and Mods

Save File Editing is a constant game-breaker for many, and we do not accept bugs that are DIRECTLY caused by save file editing. However, if the save has been edited but the bug is completely separate from it, LifeGen won't make it a big deal. We like squashing bugs!

Modded versions of LifeGen, however, are not allowed to be reported to us. Any bugs on a modded game are to be reported to the mod thread/creator.

### How do I find my game version?

#### Playing stable

If the version number isn't shown at the bottom right hand corner of the game's window, follow below:

1. If you can open the game, press the settings + info button

   !!! tip "Can't open the game?"
   Jump to [can't open the game](#cant-open-the-game).
2. Press "Open Data Directory". This will open a file explorer on your computer.

4. Find the most recent stdout file and open it in Notepad or a similar text editing program.
5. Copy the version number from the third line, "Running on commit [...]"

   !!! tip
   If you don't see something that looks like this, ensure you selected std**OUT**, not std**ERR**.

#### Playing source

On source versions of LifeGen, the commit number is in the bottom-right of every screen, so long as GIT is installed.

#### Can't open the game?

If the game immediately crashes, you can get to the default log location manually.

=== "Source"
If you are running a source code version of LifeGen, the log files are stored in a folder called `logs` within the folder the source files are located in.

=== "Stable (standalone executable)"
| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Windows | `C:\Users\[your user name]\AppData\Local\LifeGen\LifeGen/logs` |
| Mac | `/Users/[your user name]/Library/Application Support/LifeGen/logs` |
| Linux | `/home/[your user name]/.local/share/LifeGen/logs` |

### How do I find the error log?

See the section on [finding your game version](#how-do-i-find-my-game-version) to find the logs directory. Instead of
selecting `stdout`, find and upload the most recent `stderr`. You can either upload the file or copy its contents, but
the entire file's contents are required.
